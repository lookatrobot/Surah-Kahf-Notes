# Surah-Kahf-Notes:
Personal study notes on `Surah Al-Kahf`, written using authentic Quran verses and reliable Hadith to avoid any incorrect interpretation.
# Story:
I studied `29 verses` in two days along with the translation in my native language. Among these, the verses that carry very important lessons start from `verse 4-6`.
# Verses 4-6: 
These verses state:

`And to warn those who claim, ‘Allah has offspring. (18:4)`

`They have no knowledge of this, nor did their forefathers. What a terrible claim that comes out of their mouths! They say nothing but lies. (18:5)`

`Now, perhaps you ˹O Prophet˺ will grieve yourself to death over their denial, if they ˹continue to˺ disbelieve in this message. (18:6)`
## Analysis: 
These verses explain that Allah Almighty has no offspring, and that such claims are merely the result of people blindly following the paths of their forefathers. They do not think for themselves or use their own intellect. If we look at this from another perspective, we too often follow certain practices of our parents that have no real basis sometimes they are just cultural traditions or habits. The lesson we gain from these verses is that whenever we hear something or are about to do something, we should pause and reflect once to see whether it is right or not. In this, one must only avoid shirk (associating partners with God), because every sin will be forgiven after the Day of Judgment, but shirk will never be forgiven. It means that a person may have all their sins forgiven and punished, but due to shirk alone, they will remain forever in Hell.

## Verses 7:
The verse state:

`We have indeed made whatever is on earth as an adornment for it, in order to test which of them is best in deeds. 18:7`
## Analysis: 
In this world, Allah Almighty is testing us. Every human experiences all kinds of emotions. When we work hard but don’t get the results, or when someone close to us hurts us, it is a test to see how a person behaves under trial. Whenever bad times come, keep faith in Allah Almighty that He will surely give me a good reward in return, because Allah knows everything. If I don’t get it in this world, then surely I will receive it in the Hereafter, Insha’Allah, Ameen. Now, don’t say that something bad happened to me while look at how good someone else’s life is, because Allah is testing them by giving, and testing us by taking away.
