# ☾⭑ Surah-Kahf-Notes:
Personal study notes on `Surah Al-Kahf`, written using authentic Quran verses and reliable Hadith to avoid any incorrect interpretation.

# Me:
I studied `53 verses` over two days along with their translation in my native language. Among these, the verses that carry very important lessons start from…
# Verses 4-6: 
These verses state:

`And to warn those who claim, ‘Allah has offspring. (18:4)`

`They have no knowledge of this, nor did their forefathers. What a terrible claim that comes out of their mouths! They say nothing but lies. (18:5)`

`Now, perhaps you ˹O Prophet˺ will grieve yourself to death over their denial, if they ˹continue to˺ disbelieve in this message. (18:6)`
## Analysis: 
These verses explain that Allah Almighty has no offspring, and that such claims are merely the result of people blindly following the paths of their forefathers. They do not think for themselves or use their own intellect. If we look at this from another perspective, we too often follow certain practices of our parents that have no real basis sometimes they are just cultural traditions or habits. The lesson we gain from these verses is that whenever we hear something or are about to do something, we should pause and reflect once to see whether it is right or not. In this, one must only avoid shirk (associating partners with God), because every sin will be forgiven after the Day of Judgment, but shirk will never be forgiven. It means that a person may have all their sins forgiven and punished, but due to shirk alone, they will remain forever in Hell.

## Verses 7:
The verse state:

`We have indeed made whatever is on earth as an adornment for it, in order to test which of them is best in deeds. 18:7`
## Analysis: 
In this world, Allah Almighty is testing us. Every human experiences all kinds of emotions. When we work hard but don’t get the results, or when someone close to us hurts us, it is a test to see how a person behaves under trial. Whenever bad times come, keep faith in Allah Almighty that He will surely give me a good reward in return, because Allah knows everything. If I don’t get it in this world, then surely I will receive it in the Hereafter, Insha’Allah, Ameen. Now, don’t say that something bad happened to me while look at how good someone else’s life is, because Allah is testing them by giving, and testing us by taking away.

## Verses 32-42:
Verses 32–42 give an example of `two men`. Allah gives this example to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). 

`Give them ˹O Prophet˺ an example of two men. To ˹the disbelieving˺ one We gave two gardens of grapevines, which We surrounded with palm trees and placed ˹various˺ crops in between. 18:42`

## Main-Point:
The main point of Surah Kahf is the story of Ashab-e-Kahf (the People of the Cave). This story is available everywhere on the internet, but I have read it directly from the Quran to avoid any misleading information. We will discuss it later, but right now we are going to study a very important topic, which I discovered from this Surah.
## The Three Questions Asked to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) by the Jews:
I was reading verse number 24, which says:

`And never say of anything, 'Indeed, I will do that tomorrow,' except [when adding], 'If Allah wills.' But if you forget, then remember your Lord and say, 'I trust my Lord will guide me to what is more right than this. 18:24`

While reading this verse, I also read its tafseer (exegesis), which mentioned that the Jewish scholars asked Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) three questions:
1. What is the reality of the soul?
2. Who were Ashab-e-Kahf?
3. Who was Zulqarnain?

The Prophet (PBUH) `replied` that he would answer them the next day. However, Angel Jibrael (Gabriel) did not bring the answers for 15 days. Then, when the answers came, Allah commanded the Prophet to say “Inshallah” (if Allah so wills) before answering.

A person knows that whatever happens, happens by Allah’s command. So whenever we intend to do something in the future, it is necessary to say “Inshallah” because the person has the intention, but whether it happens or not is by Allah’s will. Therefore, it is better to say “Inshallah.”

These three questions were not asked all at once; rather, they were asked in different hadiths. I have found their answers directly from the Quran. The answer to the question about `Ashab-e-Kahf` is in `Surah Kahf`, and the answer about `Zulqarnain` is also in the `same Surah`. The answer to the first question about the soul is in the `17th Juz’ (para), Surah Al-Isra, verse 85`. 
## The Answer Of 1st-Question:
`“They ask you, [O Prophet], about the soul. Say, ‘The soul is of the affair of my Lord. And mankind have not been given of knowledge except a little.’” (17:85)`
## Analysis:
Even in this modern era, scientists have still not been able to completely discover what the soul is. Allah Almighty has given only a little knowledge about the soul, and it will never be fully discovered by humans because of Allah’s will. Whatever matters Allah has kept in the unseen (ghaib) contain wisdom and goodness, because I believe those matters are beyond the capacity of the human brain to fully comprehend.

## The Answer Of 3rd-Question:
The answer to the third question is in `Surah Kahf, verses 83–98`, but here I am sharing verse 83 because you can read it directly from the Quran:

`“They ask you, [O Prophet], about Dhul-Qarnain. Say, ‘I will recite to you about him a report.’” (Surah Kahf 18:83)`
## Analysis:
If you read from `verse 83` onward, it becomes clear that Dhul-Qarnain encountered `the people of Gog and Magog`, and it was he who built the barrier. Their mention is found in `verses 94–98 of Surah Kahf`, and they are also mentioned in another place in the Quran, in `Surah Al-Anbiya (21:96)`:

`“Until, when Gog and Magog are let loose, and they rush down from every elevation.” (Surah Al-Anbiya 21:96)`

`They said, “O Dhul-Qarnain! Indeed, Gog and Magog are spreading corruption in the land. Should we pay you tribute, provided that you build a barrier between us and them?” (Surah Kahf 18:94)`

## Gog And Magog:
There is a hadith in Sunan Ibn Majah (Hadith 4080) which states:

`“Gog and Magog dig every day until, when they are about to see the rays of the sun, the one in charge of them says: ‘Go back, and we will dig it tomorrow.’ Then Allah restores it, making it stronger than it was before. This continues until the time comes when Allah wants to send them against the people. They will dig until they are about to see the rays of the sun, and the one in charge of them will say: ‘Go back, and we will dig it tomorrow, if Allah wills.’ So they will say, ‘If Allah wills.’ When they return, they will find it exactly as they left it. They will then dig through and come out to the people. They will drink all the water, and the people will take refuge in their fortresses. Gog and Magog will shoot their arrows into the sky, and the arrows will return to them stained with blood. They will say, ‘We have defeated the people of the earth and overcome the people of the heavens.’ Then Allah will send a worm into the backs of their necks, and He will destroy them through it.”`

## Analysis:
The hadith shows that `Gog and Magog` almost completed the wall many times, but because they did not say `“InshaAllah,”` the wall was `rebuilt each time`. When they finally said “InshaAllah,” the wall remained as it was and they succeeded the next day. This highlights the power of saying “InshaAllah” with true belief. Likewise, we should say “InshaAllah” in every matter, trusting that if something is meant to happen, it will happen by `Allah’s command.`

## Note: 
Whenever you read the Quran, read it along with its translation only then will you understand its true meaning. `Beautiful recitation` may make it feel like we are reading the Quran, but without understanding, it is meaningless. Memorizing the Quran has no real benefit if we do not understand what it is saying.

Watch this video; it’s an Instagram reel: https://www.instagram.com/p/DJBL4UENQFp/ After watching this reel, I stopped reading the Quran `without translation.`

By making notes, I will stay motivated and be able to explore the Surahs better, but handwritten notes are not worth it. I will keep making notes for every Surah I read so that I understand the message in each one.
